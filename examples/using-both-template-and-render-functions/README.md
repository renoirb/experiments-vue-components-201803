# Sample in-browser Vue.js App

Here are a few samples on how a Vue.js works if we only wanted to use Static HTML.

The objective of this directory is to prototype on a few ideas while trying to run only from a few files and to run only **in browser**.


## Demo

To try it out, you can upload all contents from `public/` directory **as they are**.

**NO need to run dependency managers**.


## Add more examples

There is a minimal `Koa` service serving files statically from `public/`.

From this directory, run

```
yarn
yarn dev
```
